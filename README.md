## Hey there

Projects I'm currently working on:

- [rustineers](https://github.com/bstaber/rustineers): A collection of crates to learn Rust with applied sciences. I try to comment and explain my journey in a small [book](https://bstaber.github.io/rustineers/) that goes with it.
- [plaid](https://github.com/PLAID-lib/plaid): An open-source project developped by my colleagues.
- [cppxplorers](https://github.com/bstaber/cppxplorers): A C++ mono-repository playground. There's a [book](https://bstaber.github.io/cppxplorers) I try to fill as well.
- [kernax](https://gitlab.com/drti/kernax): A small JAX-based package that implements kernel methods. I've been refactoring that library a bit.
- [pbnn](https://github.com/bstaber/pbnn): A code that benchmarks UQ methods for neural networks in JAX and PyTorch. I'm cleaning this up as well.
- [Python lecture notes](https://bstaber.github.io/ensai-2a-prog-alg-ml/): Some lecture notes for a lecture I give about implementing algorithms in Python. I'm trying out marp.
- [Marimo notebooks](https://bstaber.github.io/python-ml-tutorials-marimo/): Some notebooks that go along with the lecture notes. Trying to make nice visual examples.

Experimenting:
- [uv python monorepo](https://github.com/bstaber/uv-monorepo-example): Trying out `uv` workspaces to make a Python monorepository. It looks really cool and close to what we would do with Cargo (probably not surprising).

Older stuff:

- [TrilinosUQComp](https://github.com/bstaber/TrilinosUQComp): A 3D parallel finite element solver I made during my PhD thesis. It relies on [Trilinos](https://trilinos.github.io/) and good old `Epetra` (which is deprecated now). It was my first C++ project, it has several flaws but I was happy with it! Nowadays I would probably use [Spack](https://spack.io/) and rewrite the finite element solvers with [Kokkos](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos)/[Tpetra](https://trilinos.github.io/tpetra.html).
- [BaTorch](https://gitlab.com/drti/batorch): A code for benchmarking Bayesian neural networks with PyTorch and [Hydra](https://hydra.cc/) We implemented several Bayesian methods for deep neural networks, and kernel-based distances stuff like the maximum mean discrepancy and the kernelized Stein discrepancy. It is outdated but I plan to use Hydra again in another project.
